Zero Dependencies: I certify that I have NOT added any runtime dependencies
(npm: or jsr:) to the Core logic.

Web Standards First: I used universal APIs (globalThis, console) instead of
runtime-specific ones (process, Deno.*), ensuring compatibility across Browsers,
Node, and Deno.

Composition over Inheritance: I respected the architecture of wrapping the
native console rather than extending it unsafely.
