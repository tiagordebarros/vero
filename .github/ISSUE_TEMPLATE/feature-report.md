📣 The Pitch

Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. (Ex: I'm always
frustrated when I need to log XML strings...)

💡 Proposed Solution

Describe the solution you'd like. (Ex: I would like a method logger.xml() that
formats the output...)

🔌 Architecture Check (Crucial)

Remember: Vero follows a strict "Core Law". The core must remain tiny (~30KB)
and dependency-free.

Does this feature require external dependencies (npm packages)?

[ ] Yes

[ ] No

If YES: This feature likely belongs in a Plugin, not the Core. Are you proposing
a new official plugin (e.g., @vero/plugin-xml)?

If NO: Explain why this should be in the Core and not a Plugin.

🔄 Alternatives Considered

Describe alternatives you've considered.

📸 Mockups (Optional)

If this feature changes the visual output, please show us a "ASCII Art" mockup
of how it should look.
