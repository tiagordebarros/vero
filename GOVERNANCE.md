# Governance Model

This document defines how Vero is maintained and governed.

---

## Project Ownership

Vero is currently maintained by its original author and core maintainer:

Tiago Ribeiro de Barros

The maintainer has final decision authority on:

- Architectural changes
- Core dependency policy
- Major releases
- Breaking changes

---

## Decision Making

Vero follows a **Maintainer-Led Governance Model**.

### How decisions are made:

1. Community discussion via Issues or Discussions
2. Evaluation based on Core Law and architectural principles
3. Final decision by the maintainer

Consensus is encouraged but not required.

---

## Contribution Model

Vero welcomes contributions via:

- Pull Requests
- Issue reports
- Documentation improvements
- Plugin development

All contributions must comply with:

- CONTRIBUTING.md
- SECURITY.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

---

## Becoming a Core Contributor

Core contributors may be invited based on:

- High-quality contributions
- Architectural alignment
- Community behavior
- Long-term engagement

Becoming a core contributor does not grant automatic decision authority over
architectural matters.

---

## Core Law Supremacy

The "Vero Core Law" takes precedence over feature proposals.

If a contribution violates the Core Law:

- It may be rejected
- It may be redirected to a Plugin
- It may be redirected to a Theme

Architectural integrity is prioritized over feature expansion.

---

## Transparency

Major decisions will be documented in:

- GitHub Discussions
- Release Notes
- RFC Issues (if applicable)

---

Vero aims to grow sustainably without compromising its minimalistic philosophy.
